# AI-Based Sorting Robot Arm

## Overview

The AI-Based Sorting Robot Arm project integrates artificial intelligence with ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) to create a robotic arm capable of efficient object detection, recognition, and sorting. The system employs a camera for visual input, allowing precise positioning of objects relative to the robot's base frame. The inverse kinematics are computed, and the solutions are sent to an Arduino via serial communication. The Arduino actuates the motors to move the end effector to the desired position, facilitating the accurate placement of objects into designated containers.

## Features

- Object detection and recognition using cutting-edge AI algorithms.
- ROS2 integration for seamless robot control and coordination.
- Real-time camera feed processing for accurate object identification.
- Flexible sorting capabilities adaptable to various objects and scenarios.
- Efficient pick and place operations executed by the robotic manipulator.

## Dependencies

- ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) Humble
- Gazebo Ignition Fortress
- Python (version 3.10.12)
- OpenCV (version 4.7.0.68)
- YOLO (for AI-based object detection)
- C++ Serial Library (libserial-dev)
- ikpy package for kinematics 

## Installation

1. **ROS2 Installation on Ubuntu 22.04:**
   [ROS2 Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)

2. **Gazebo Ignition Fortress:**
   [Gazebo Installation Guide](https://gazebosim.org/docs/fortress/install_ubuntu)

3. **OpenCV (version 4.7.0.68) using PIP:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python==4.7.0.68
   ```

4. **YOLO (for AI-based object detection):**
   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics
   ```

5. **C++ Serial Library:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libserial-dev
   ```

## Usage

Launch the packages in the following order:

1. Gazebo simulation and controllers:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch robotic_arm_description robot_arm_gazebo.launch.py
   ros2 launch robotic_arm_controllers robot_arm_controllers.launch.py
   ```

2. Recognition using simulation camera:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch robotic_arm_recognition robotic_arm_recognition_model.launch.py
   ```

   OR, if using a physical camera:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch robotic_arm_camera robot_arm_camera.launch.py
   ```
3. Transformation of the dynamic links (detected objects)
   ```bash
   ros2 launch robotic_arm_transforms transforms.launch.xml
   ```
4. Solving the IK problems and computing the forward kinematics
   ```bash
   ros2 launch robotic_arm_kinematics robotic_arm_kinematics.launch.py
   ```

All the packages can be launch using this single command
   - Simulation:
     ```bash
     ros2 launch robotic_arm_bringup sim_robotic_arm.launch.py
     ```
   - Real robot:
     ```bash
     ros2 launch robotic_arm_bringup real_robotic_arm.launch.py
     ```

**Note:** Launch each package in a separate terminal window after sourcing.
