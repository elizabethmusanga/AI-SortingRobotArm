# AI-Based Sorting Robot Arm

## Overview

The AI-Based Sorting Robot Arm project aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence for object detection and recognition, integrated with ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2), to enable a manipulator to perform pick and place operations efficiently. This project utilizes a camera as input, leveraging its visual data to identify and sort objects with precision.

## Features

- Object detection and recognition using state-of-the-art AI algorithms.
- Seamless integration with ROS2 for robot control and coordination.
- Real-time camera feed processing for object identification.
- Flexible sorting capabilities for diverse objects and scenarios.
- Efficient pick and place operations with robotic manipulator.

## Dependencies
